# RECURSION C++ COSC 333 Assignment
# Factorial and Fibonacci Calculator functions

## Description
This c++ program has two functions Fibonacci and factorial to calculate the factorial of an input and the Fibonacci series up to an input value.
 
## Features
- Computes the factorial of a user-inputted number.
- Computes the Fibonacci sequence up to a user-inputted number.
- Uses memoization to store previously computed values for efficiency.
- Measures execution time in microseconds.

## Requirements
- C++ Compiler (e.g., g++)

## Compilation
To compile the program, use the following command
```
 g++ Factorial.cpp -o Factorial
 g++ Fibonacci.cpp -o Fibonacci
```

## Usage
To run the factorial program:
```bash
 ./Factorial
```
Then enter a number when prompted.

To run the Fibonacci program:
```bash
 ./Fibonacci
```
The Fibonacci sequence is pre-set to compute for `Number = 10`, but you can modify it in the source code.
